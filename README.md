This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Reading from, and writing to, the chain is managed in `pages/demo.js`. To select local, Rinkeby or Goerli testnets, comment in/out the relevant config options.

## Getting Started

First, install any relevant packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Sometimes, react-reveal can be a bit temperamental after the first npm install. It's not great practice but you can fix this with:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Once packages are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
